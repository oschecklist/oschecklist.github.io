ID and tags ?
- description is HTML ? makes it easier to display, just do an innerHTML set
  (makes it bulkier, but not to an appreciable degree)
- tags + id + (something to order and group things?) determine what to show in what order
- need to save what step on, what groups wanted, what has been saved for later
- Yes/No buttons or checkboxes and green tick marks for "done" instead of the generic green tick / generic red X I currently have
